#MarksUp

The goal of Markup is to create an intuitive language able to create form elements, where content might be more interactive. Hence the 'up'. Markdown is known to render read-only text aptly, but has been Marksup's inspiration.

With simplicity in mind, there are certain assumptions made:
- Elements will be created top down, each element written on a new line
- Certain assumptions are made when it comes to the attributes of the elements

Let's dive into an example

	Choose an Email ?
	_____

	Choose a password
	******

	Describe why you want to register
	____
	_____

	Gender
	male/female

	Which of these features will you need?
	- simplicity
	- easy to use from a mobile

	[ok]

Currently Markup supports

- Text Input( single line input)

	______

- Text Area ( multi-line input)

	______ ( use 2 or more consecutive lines of underscores )
	______

- Password field
	
	***** 

- Button
	
	\[caption\] ( will create a button with the label caption )
